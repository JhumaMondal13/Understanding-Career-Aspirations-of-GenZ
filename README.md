Introduction 📝
The goal of this project was to analyze and understand the career aspirations of GenZ. By leveraging data analytics, I aimed to provide insights that could help KultureHire tailor their services to better meet the needs and aspirations of this demographic.Following are the steps I followed to make this project:

1. Problem Statement and Documentation 📚
I began by thoroughly understanding the problem statement. The key questions I sought to answer included:
- What are the most popular career aspirations among GenZ?
- What factors influence their career choices?
- How do these aspirations vary across different demographics?

To gain deeper insights into the problem statement, I explored various articles and resources. The documentation captured the business aspects of Gen Z's career aspirations using the 5W1H framework (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How).


2. Data Collection and Survey 📋
Data collection was carried out through surveys designed to capture a broad range of information regarding GenZ's career aspirations. I created a survey link and shared it on social media to gather responses. The survey included questions about preferred career fields, influencing factors, educational background, and demographic details.
